/**
 * Where the app is, as a URL.
 *
 * Three places exist, and each one is addressable so it can be bookmarked,
 * reloaded and shared between the tabs of the same device:
 *
 *  - `/` — the public marketing page, prerendered for crawlers;
 *  - `/app` — the spaces on this device;
 *  - `/app/<id>` — one space's messages, the id being local to this device;
 *  - `/app/<id>/devices` — that space's devices.
 *
 * A space's sections are routes rather than local state so that stepping into
 * one is a real navigation: the browser's Back button (and Android's) walks
 * back out of it instead of leaving the space altogether.
 *
 * The id in the URL is a random local id, deliberately unrelated to the
 * space's id on the server: a URL that leaks (a screenshot, a shared tab, a
 * synced browser history) then says nothing about the space it names, and
 * cannot be used to reach it from anywhere else.
