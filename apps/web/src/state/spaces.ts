/**
 * The spaces this device holds, and which one the app is currently in.
 *
 * A space is the unit of everything else: one session, one keyring, one
 * history, one URL (`/app/<id>`). The app works in exactly one at a time — the
 * one the route names — so opening a space is what loads its session into the
 * signals the rest of the UI reads, and closing it is what unloads them.
 *
 * The registry lives in db/spaces.ts; this module is the reactive view of it
 * plus the lifecycle: open, create, forget. Renaming is in sync/spaceName.ts,
 * because a name belongs to the space rather than to the device holding it.
